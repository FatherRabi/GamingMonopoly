## Lessons Learned ##
This project extended our knowledge in understanding on how to further implement d3 in an interactive environment such as this. After doing a lot of research with similar income related funnel charts, it became clear that the complexity of creating something like this would be involved but would be a great challenge nonetheless. We learned a great deal with how to make a complex JSON file to read and connect with our js file and the data within it and this was one of the main hurdles we needed to understand to display the project in our HTML file.
